- EMPTY locations should be handled
- upload a file where the name already exists
- Can we use this: if (std::system(command.c_str()) == 0) ???
- Which part of a path should be taken to validate the allowed methods in a location
- We should remove the ENV for the CGI afterwards?
- When there is a request with multipart/data or chunked we need a function to reassemble the body
- if there is no index in the location, dont return auto off, but an empty string
- The back home on the error page does not work
- In the fileupload branch now its not wrkong if only the / is requested. The index is shown but then i cant go to the other pages.

- xhr.open('POST', 'http://' + host + ':' + port, true); should go t oxhr.open('POST', 'http://' + host + ':' + port + '/uploads/', true); becuase / is POST not allowed!!!

- The host shouldnt be empty in the request
- How to handle large file uploads and timeouts. What should happen when the page during a large upload is refrehsed
- Post files with the content in the body without multipart --> Yann?
